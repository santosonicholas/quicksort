# SINGULAR QUICKSORT AND PARALLEL QUICKSORT

This is a comparison between singular quicksort and parallel quicksort

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
GCC
```

### Installing

```
Give the example
```

## Running the tests

Test is done with both sequential and parallel quicksort programs to find the average time taken to finish quicksorting with a sample size of 10, 100, 1000 and 10000.

### Singular Quicksort

```
Give an example
```

### Parallel Quicksort

```
Give an example
```

## Result

Test is done with both sequential 
and parallel quicksort programs to find the average time taken to finish quicksorting with a sample size of 10, 100, 1000 and 10000.
